The Zodiac Tournament DLC is inspired by classic martial arts movies, where Wei Shen, the protagonist of Sleeping Dogs, is invited to an exclusive fighting tournament on a hidden island. There, he must face the best fighters from across Asia and emerge victorious. The DLC has a retro style and a lot of references to Bruce Lee and other kung fu legends.
 
But there is also a hidden secret on the island: a stash of cocaine that you can find and use. To do this, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. After arriving on the island, go to the left side of the pier and look for a small boat with a blue tarp. There is a fire opal statue on the boat, which is one of the collectibles of the DLC.
2. Grab the statue and jump into the water. Swim to the right side of the pier and look for a wooden platform with some crates and barrels. Climb up and look for a red barrel with a white skull on it.
3. Interact with the barrel and Wei will say "What do we have here?". A cutscene will play where Wei opens the barrel and finds a bag of cocaine inside. He will then snort some of it and say "That's some good shit".
4. Congratulations! You have just found and used free cocaine on Zodiac Island. You will notice that Wei's health bar will turn white and he will move faster and hit harder for a short time. You can also use the cocaine again if you return to the barrel later.

So there you have it. A hidden easter egg that adds some extra fun and humor to the Zodiac Tournament DLC. If you have not played it yet, you can buy it for $4.99 on Steam[^2^]. It is a great addition to Sleeping Dogs and a tribute to the martial arts genre. Just be careful not to overdose on cocaine!

If you are wondering whether the Zodiac Tournament DLC is worth your money and time, here are some of the pros and cons of this expansion:
 
## Pros

- The DLC has a great atmosphere and homage to the classic kung fu movies, with retro graphics, cheesy dialogue and references to Bruce Lee and other icons.
- The DLC adds some new gameplay elements, such as new fighting styles, new enemies, new outfits and new collectibles. You can also use environmental objects and traps to your advantage.
- The DLC has a decent length, with six missions that can take you around two hours to complete. You can also replay them and explore the island freely after finishing the main story.
- The DLC has some humor and surprises, such as the hidden cocaine easter egg, the quirky characters and the twist at the end.

## Cons

- The DLC is mostly focused on combat, which can get repetitive and frustrating at times. There is not much variety or challenge in the fights, and some of them are unfair or buggy.
- The DLC does not have much impact on the main story or the character development of Wei Shen. It feels like a standalone adventure that does not add much to the overall plot or lore of Sleeping Dogs.
- The DLC is not very polished or optimized, with some graphical glitches, audio issues and performance problems. Some users have reported crashes or freezes while playing the DLC.
- The DLC is not very original or innovative, as it borrows a lot of elements from other games or movies. It does not offer anything new or groundbreaking to the genre or the franchise.

Overall, the Zodiac Tournament DLC is a fun and entertaining expansion that pays tribute to the martial arts cinema. It is not perfect or essential, but it is a good way to spend some time with Wei Shen and his fists of fury. If you are a fan of Sleeping Dogs and kung fu movies, you might enjoy this DLC. If you are looking for something more substantial or meaningful, you might want to skip it.
